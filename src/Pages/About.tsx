      Hello, I'm Helen Ã•unsaar and I'm looking for a job in software development.
      I got my first software development experience when I took part in the "Vali-IT!" course.
      Unfortunately, at that moment, I could not continue my path as a software developer, but the desire to develop in this field still exists.
      I also plan to continuously study and develop my skills.
      My biggest advantages are conscientiousness, learning from my mistakes, a desire to learn, good communication skills, and the ability to work in a team.
